# employee-classes-java-with-tests
In this project, I demonstrate my knowledge and skills with test-driven development (TDD), unit testing, Git version control and best practices such as feature branching and good commit messages, Java and object-oriented programming (OOP).

The code is written with well-defined variable names, short methods that are focused on single tasks and demonstrates a class hierarchy.

The unit tests and input validation provided are non-exhaustive examples.
